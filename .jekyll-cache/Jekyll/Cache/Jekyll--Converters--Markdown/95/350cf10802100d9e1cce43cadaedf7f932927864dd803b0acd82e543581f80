I"x<p>Performance has an impact on the quality of the application and the user experience. There are different decisions that impact the overall performance of an application, from how we code to how the application infrastructure is configured. In this post we will focus on how to write our React applications to optimize them.

This will lead to a fast user interface without doing much work to specifically optimize for performance. Nevertheless, there are several ways you can speed up your React application.</p>
