<h2>About</h2>

<p>I'm a Full Stack Web Developer and a Freelance Software Engineer with 6+ years of experience. I initially started developing on the backend, but I am currently focused on the frontend. I also do freelance work where I can take your idea and build it from the ground up. This includes everything from server creation and management,  backend and API endpoints, HTML5/CSS/Javascript frontend, testing suite, build systems and deployment process.</p>


<p>Currently, I am learning DevOps tools like Kubernetes and automation tools that makes me productive to avoid to do context switching. I learned Docker and GitHub Actions for CI/CD two years ago and it completely changed the way I work. Also, as part of my constant learning, I am improving on my programming skills, learning new patterns and principles in programming.</p>

<p>I sympathize with work teams that promote diversity, proactivity, build quality software, enjoy working, sharing what they know, and contributing to open source.</p>

<p>About this post, I created it as part of my process of learning. Also, I think this content might help someone else.</p>
